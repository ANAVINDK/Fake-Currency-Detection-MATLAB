# Fake-Currency-Detection-MATLAB
### MATLAB code for fake Indian currency detection.

Image segmentation done using Color thresholder app.
By changing images in the dataset we can detect any currency.
Support Vector Machine classification is done on these texture features. It will classify as fake or genuine. 
Warning: Use a better dataset as the dataset provided with code is not a good one.
Also correction need to be done in Image segmentation section as well.
